For a rider considering a mid-size Supersport bike that&#8217;s at home or the track or the street, there&#8217;s only one choice; the Suzuki GSX-R600.</p><p><strong>Features may include:</strong></p><ul><li>ENGINE </li></ul><p>A compact 599cc, four-cylinder engine with a race-proven over-square bore/stroke ratio produces remarkably strong high rpm power delivery.</p><p>The energy-efficient engine employs forged pistons, shot-peened connecting rods, chrome-nitride-coated upper compression and oil control rings, and pentagonal ventilation holes to reduce frictional and mechanical losses.</p><p>Camshafts with aggressive valve-lift profiles were developed using proven MotoGP racing engine technology – the first time this method has been applied to a production Suzuki.</p><ul><li>CHASSIS </li></ul><p>Lightweight and compact twin-spar aluminum alloy frame is constructed of five cast sections to produce a balance of light weight and strength.</p><p>The frame is mated with a cast aluminum swingarm and multi-piece rear sub-frame that&#8217;s ready for racetrack use.</p><p>Race-developed, lightweight Showa Big Piston Front Fork (BPF) delivers superb feedback and consistent performance.</p><ul><li>ADDITIONAL </li></ul><p>Stylized Suzuki &#8220;S&#8221; 3-D emblems on the fuel tank and the fork upper bracket denotes the quality, sophistication, and performance legacy of the brand.</p><p>Optional single seat cowl can replace the passenger seat for an even more aggressive look or for use on solo rides or track days.</p>","WHITE","WHITE","","","","","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/D8/1C/D81CC18B-A599-4F37-90A8-DFB7A18AC691.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/60/14/6014407E-E371-43A2-946E-0A76FC7541F0.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/42/DD/42DDC0FB-2510-4FCC-B2E8-C46F2B360C83.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/6E/30/6E307452-1B26-4380-8896-4B7F0E3A3F48.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/CE/58/CE583039-8166-46F2-A8F1-C3961A9CE736.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/EB/22/EB226543-747B-4B96-94DE-1CA29CA76307.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/7D/C8/7DC8D061-7F08-4F4E-AE2D-FE703A4AD0C7.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/93/0B/930BF9CF-AAE1-4234-9CE5-F1399CD48B5E.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/68/4F/684F4998-E0DC-4E37-956E-7A633F79DFC1.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/CE/5C/CE5C9E54-7865-40A6-AFFF-88CB417DF2A3.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/9C/4C/9C4C810F-2544-464D-8A9B-20075B483328.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/17/5B/175BAE4E-5BB2-4EF7-B5D9-97FA2FCA0BF0.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/FD/56/FD56426B-BDD1-4DB5-B261-14500DA96528.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/AF/DD/AFDDBFF2-4715-4D0A-8126-FF8A344AEE92.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/1E/84/1E84416A-139C-4C56-B1A4-6BAB647C8F4F.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/D6/51/D651AF6A-AA48-4A7B-9C3F-937D65540AA6.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A6/22/A6220F01-566C-4E6F-9636-CFEA3712D39B.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/DF/7D/DF7DB13F-7560-4EC6-ADDA-C8E7FA50E451.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/93/3A/933A978D-1F37-4A5D-90C4-126D3774E256.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/F5/C5/F5C5219E-2A5C-4E9F-A318-3F146F8F5B74.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A9/9E/A99E040C-B84C-46FC-861F-76CBB6070D2C.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/72/09/72090D18-8907-4C07-9B8E-06027728EDA8.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A2/2D/A22D3946-5016-4619-8651-6A9A28388490.jpg","Sport","Racer","True","0"

It's ultra-responsive to rider input for effortless handling, and packs instant power delivery for conquering intimidating mountain terrain.</p><p><strong>Features may include:</strong></p><strong>ROTAX 600R E-TEC ENGINE</strong><ul><li>INSTANT POWER. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE.</li></ul><p>Following its big brother Rotax 850 E-TEC engine's lead with second generation E-TEC technology, the Rotax 600R E-TEC engine offers a 30% improvement in throttle response**, crisp acceleration and sets a new 600cc class standard with 125 horsepower* while continuing to set the bar for reliability, and 2-stroke oil and fuel economy.</p><strong>E-TEC SHOT STARTER</strong><ul><li>EASIEST STARTING</li></ul><p>Push-button starting with almost no added weight. After an initial pull-start, the engine charges an ultracapacitor. Pushing the handlebar SHOT button for subsequent starts uses energy stored in the ultracapacitor to turn the magneto into an electric motor that rotates the flywheel, and with E-TEC technology, starts the engine. Eliminates nearly 20 lb. (9 kg) compared to conventional electric start. SHOT starting is only possible with Ski-Doo-exclusive E-TEC technology.</p><strong>REV Gen4 PLATFORM</strong><ul><li>NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</li></ul><p>Key to the Summit’s agility is the extreme mass centralization of the 4th generation REV platform. The trademark pyramidal frame, new die-cast aluminum front suspension module and new heat exchanger design ensure it’s strong, yet lightweight.</p><strong>COOL AIR FLOW</strong><ul><li>KEEPING IT COOL</li></ul><p>Side panel venting improves airflow to drive components for cooler operations and optimal performance.</p><strong>PDRIVE CLUTCH</strong><ul><li>QUICK, EFFICIENT, EASY</li></ul><p>A major factor in the quickness of REV sleds is the new pDrive clutch. Fast and friction-free dual rollers transfer torque in place of traditional sliding buttons on this 100% clutch. The oversize rollers with needle bearings, wide flyweights and shaft-on-shaft design emphasize smooth operation and long life. Ultra-responsive shifting, impressive RPM consistency and 2.8 lb./ 1.3 kg lighter than the TRA VII.</p><strong>TMOTION REAR SUSPENSION</strong><ul><li>CARVES WITH YOU</li></ul><p>The tMotion flexes laterally, reducing the effort to initiate a roll, due to a ball joint at the center hinge between the rear arm and drop link and split flat-tube front arms. Very progressive motion ratio makes the ride on trails even more comfortable.</p><strong>POWDERMAX LIGHT TRACK WITH FLEXEDGE</strong><ul><li>HEAVY ON PERFORMANCE</li></ul><p>New 3.5 in. (9 cm) pitch reduces weight, and keeps snow between lugs for added performance. Exclusive 16-in (41-cm) wide design adds flotation and traction without sacrificing manoeuvrability.

It's ultra-responsive to rider input for effortless handling, and packs instant power delivery for conquering intimidating mountain terrain.</p><p><strong>Features may include:</strong></p><strong>ROTAX 600R E-TEC ENGINE</strong><ul><li>INSTANT POWER. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE.</li></ul><p>Following its big brother Rotax 850 E-TEC engine's lead with second generation E-TEC technology, the Rotax 600R E-TEC engine offers a 30% improvement in throttle response**, crisp acceleration and sets a new 600cc class standard with 125 horsepower* while continuing to set the bar for reliability, and 2-stroke oil and fuel economy.</p><strong>E-TEC SHOT STARTER</strong><ul><li>EASIEST STARTING</li></ul><p>Push-button starting with almost no added weight. After an initial pull-start, the engine charges an ultracapacitor. Pushing the handlebar SHOT button for subsequent starts uses energy stored in the ultracapacitor to turn the magneto into an electric motor that rotates the flywheel, and with E-TEC technology, starts the engine. Eliminates nearly 20 lb. (9 kg) compared to conventional electric start. SHOT starting is only possible with Ski-Doo-exclusive E-TEC technology.</p><strong>REV Gen4 PLATFORM</strong><ul><li>NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</li></ul><p>Key to the Summit&#8217;s agility is the extreme mass centralization of the 4th generation REV platform. The trademark pyramidal frame, new die-cast aluminum front suspension module and new heat exchanger design ensure it&#8217;s strong, yet lightweight.</p><strong>COOL AIR FLOW</strong><ul><li>KEEPING IT COOL</li></ul><p>Side panel venting improves airflow to drive components for cooler operations and optimal performance.</p><strong>PDRIVE CLUTCH</strong><ul><li>QUICK, EFFICIENT, EASY</li></ul><p>A major factor in the quickness of REV sleds is the new pDrive clutch. Fast and friction-free dual rollers transfer torque in place of traditional sliding buttons on this 100% clutch. The oversize rollers with needle bearings, wide flyweights and shaft-on-shaft design emphasize smooth operation and long life. Ultra-responsive shifting, impressive RPM consistency and 2.8 lb./ 1.3 kg lighter than the TRA VII.</p><strong>TMOTION REAR SUSPENSION</strong><ul><li>CARVES WITH YOU</li></ul><p>The tMotion flexes laterally, reducing the effort to initiate a roll, due to a ball joint at the center hinge between the rear arm and drop link and split flat-tube front arms. Very progressive motion ratio makes the ride on trails even more comfortable.</p><strong>POWDERMAX LIGHT TRACK WITH FLEXEDGE</strong><ul><li>HEAVY ON PERFORMANCE</li></ul><p>New 3.5 in. (9 cm) pitch reduces weight, and keeps snow between lugs for added performance. Exclusive 16-in (41-cm) wide design adds flotation and traction without sacrificing manoeuvrability.

What if we could match The Beast’s interstellar performance to all day, two-up comfort? What if we would train the most dynamic naked bike ever to race any paved road the world has on offer? Regardless of the weather. Over and over again. So we brought out the big guns, aiming for state-of-the-art ergonomics, electronics and extreme stamina. The result is a long distance V-twin rocket that proudly roars past the top of the food chain, hungry for more. For miles. The faster, the better. A motorcycle that is equally happy hunting horizons, as it is chasing superbikes. And crushing them – not only at cruising speeds. Welcome to the world of the 1290 Super Duke GT, where refinement, comfort, speed and ultimate performance rule.</p><strong>Features may include:</strong><ul><li>WP SEMI-ACTIVE SUSPENSION</li></ul><p>The innovative WP semi-active suspension system introduces a new level of comfort and safety in motorcycle riding. The rider can select three spectrums of use: ‘Comfort’, ‘Street’ and ‘Sport’, while the SCU (Suspension Control Unit) adapts the damping rates in real-time to the riding surface and rider, based on the information provided by a set of stroke sensors and accelerometers. It also reads the vehicle load, making the suspension suited to different weights.</p><ul><li>FRAME AND SUBFRAME</li></ul><p>The laser-cut, chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame, welded to the highest standards, contributes to excellent chassis geometry. It's extremely stable and weighs only 9.8 kg, which helps keep the overall weight down: 212 kg (ready to ride, without fuel) and 228 kg fully fueled and ready to race the sun.</p><ul><li>SINGLE-SIDED SWINGARM</li></ul><p>The jaw-droppingly beautiful, light alloy, single-sided swingarm on the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT is not only the lightest in its class, but also meticulously manufactured and generously dimensioned – a reassuring partner when the Super Duke GT unleashes its full potential. The rear wheel is fitted to an axle that is 50 mm in diameter and bolted in place with a 60 mm central wheel nut. A high-precision, eccentric adjuster is used for tensioning the chain.</p><ul><li>BRAKES</li></ul><p>More than adequate deceleration is ensured at the front wheel by the two radially mounted Brembo M50 four-piston Monoblock calipers, actuated by a radial brake pump, each gripping onto floating 320 mm discs. The spacing between hand brake lever and handlebar is adjustable so that the lever is within easy reach for every rider. The front brake receives effective support from the disc brake on the rear wheel, which features a 240 mm diameter disc and a two-piston Brembo caliper. The enormous potential of the Brembo brakes can be exploited to the full thanks to its sportily tuned anti-lock braking system. The ABS even has a supermoto mode, for when you absolutely feel like backing it in while on holiday.</p><ul><li>WHEELS AND TIRES</li></ul><p>The Pirelli Angel GT’s on the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT offer eager steering, with a broad grip range and fantastic stability. These tubeless sports tires are fitted on alloy rims manufactured in a low-pressure die casting process. Not only do these featherweight wheels make the bike lighter overall, they also minimize the unsprung masses and moment of inertia, with a positive impact on the handling and ride dynamics.</p><ul><li>STEERING DAMPER</li></ul><p>With so much propulsive power, the front wheel could become very light, which could quickly lead to unpleasant kick-back on uneven roads or following a slight stimulus at the handlebar. The Super Duke GT prevents this safely with a reliable and sensitive WP steering damper.</p>","","VBKV69405HM954040 ","","","","","","","","0","False","False","","","False","0","False","SALE","255","1-OWNER, ONLY 19456 MILES, KTM SIDE BAGS, TANK BAG, ABS, TRACTION CONTROL, CRUISE CONTROL, RIDE MODES CONTROL, WP ADJUSTABLE SUSPENSION, HEATED GRIPS, ONBOARD COMPUTER, R&G TAIL TIDY, LED REAR SIGNALS AND TAILLIGHT, ROX HANDLEBAR RISERS, NEW FRONT TIRE AND MORE!

Weighing in at around 62 kg, the extremely slim four-valve unit is one of the lightest big twins in the world, yet it still develops no less than 180 hp peak power and 144 Nm maximum torque.</p><ul><li>ERGONOMICS</li></ul><p>Have you ever thought about seat position? Stack and reach, leg arch length, seat height, seat foam, knee angle and knee contact, handlebar width, position and offset, the shore hardness of grip rubbers, tall riders, short riders, fat or skinny – simply everything is as it should be on the new 1290 Super Duke R. Simply get on and feel comfortable. Everyone.

The new chassis structure and design makes it possible to change the rider positioning, centralize vehicle mass, redesign the rear suspension, add more power, remove weight, and evolve the rider’s riding experience. In short, it is the key to delivering rider-balanced control, unrivaled acceleration, and rider-centric comfort.</p><ul><li>Rider Balanced Positioning</li></ul><p>On the new AXYS™ chassis, the rider is moved forward to a more balanced position.  The rider’s hands are moved 4.5” forward, the feet are 2” forward, the knees are 4.5” forward, and the seat is 4.5” forward. In the neutral riding position, the AXYS™ platform provides bite for flatter, positive cornering. When the trail gets rough or the rider jumps off into the powder, rider balance enables the rider to move back and make the front end light to climb up on top of the snow or the moguls.</p><ul><li>Active Pitch Control™</li></ul><p>The all-new PRO-XC™ suspension delivers Active Pitch Control™ which controls the pitch by suspension geometry and not simply by a high spring rate. This makes the sled less sensitive to adjustment while allowing optimal weight transfer.</p><strong>UNRIVALED ACCELERATION</strong><ul><li>Lightweight</li></ul><p>When developing the AXYS™ platform, Polaris engineers minimized weight throughout the sled without compromising strength.

CLEAN TRAIL SLED!<br /> <br /> <h3>2015 Polaris&#174; 800 Switchback&#174; PRO-S</h3><strong>Smoothest Riding, Most Versatile.</strong><p>Built on the all-new AXYS&#8482; platform, the industry&#8217;s best crossover sleds just got better.</p><strong>Standard Features May Include:</strong><strong>RIDER BALANCED CONTROL</strong><ul><li>AXYS&#8482; Chassis</li></ul><p>The all new AXYS&#8482; chassis features 93% new parts, including a carbon-fiber overstructure. The new chassis structure and design makes it possible to change the rider positioning, centralize vehicle mass, redesign the rear suspension, add more power, remove weight, and evolve the rider&#8217;s riding experience. In short, it is the key to delivering rider-balanced control, unrivaled acceleration, and rider-centric comfort.</p><ul><li>Rider Balanced Positioning</li></ul><p>On the new AXYS&#8482; chassis, the rider is moved forward to a more balanced position. The rider&#8217;s hands are moved 4.5&#8221; forward, the feet are 2&#8221; forward, the knees are 4.5&#8221; forward, and the seat is 4.5&#8221; forward. In the neutral riding position, the AXYS&#8482; platform provides bite for flatter, positive cornering. When the trail gets rough or the rider jumps off into the powder, rider balance enables the rider to move back and make the front end light to climb up on top of the snow or the moguls.</p><ul><li>Active Pitch Control&#8482;</li></ul><p>The all-new PRO-XC&#8482; suspension delivers Active Pitch Control&#8482; which controls the pitch by suspension geometry and not simply by a high spring rate. This makes the sled less sensitive to adjustment while allowing optimal weight transfer.</p><strong>UNRIVALED ACCELERATION</strong><ul><li>Lightweight</li></ul><p>When developing the AXYS&#8482; platform, Polaris engineers minimized weight throughout the sled without compromising strength. The 800 Switchback PRO-S is more than 35 pounds lighter than the previous chassis and weighs approximately 40 lb. less than a competitive crossover model.</p><ul><li>800 Cleanfire&#174; H.O.

The clean, neatly shaped body lines are aimed to be appealing to a wide range of riders.</li></ul><strong>ADDITIONAL</strong><ul><li>Stylized Suzuki &#8220;S&#8221; 3D emblems on the fuel tank and the fork upper bracket denote the quality, sophistication, and performance legacy of the brand.</li></ul><ul><li>A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for SV owners are available, including a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.</li></ul>","BLUE/SIL","BLUE/SIL","","","","","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/B5/AA/B5AADC2D-05F2-4255-99A0-77F1427A57D1.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/9A/43/9A435EFF-ED9D-488A-AA19-A4C2A49DD51F.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/BA/C3/BAC304A9-D1EE-4C07-8074-BE5D4B3BD3A2.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/43/34/4334137F-B91E-4AB6-9279-336F3E2FF5CE.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/59/08/59089CA8-7D82-4CC6-B8AF-72874BA51E06.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/8A/F7/8AF710E0-5A2A-4E7E-904E-7335DEADAA8A.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/0A/3B/0A3BAFD1-BD16-49B6-8F7C-B483BB8FC96B.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/0E/6F/0E6F218A-5B8F-4DDE-9660-688DED374E5E.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/AA/BE/AABE5D78-3554-4571-8028-F05509FE4870.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/59/1C/591CEBA4-984F-4077-B2D6-DC3A165DDC6D.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/99/1E/991E11C2-D9C7-4B36-BA70-22C9E4189528.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/D5/56/D5565768-E85A-49EF-9FD1-AA28F0513457.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/0D/04/0D043580-1747-4807-882E-E071DD424285.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/47/42/474240B5-16E2-41A7-9DD4-57AF94A34158.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/F9/D2/F9D26AFA-C5A2-4615-8C50-2A4F546777B0.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/42/E7/42E73449-FFBE-4872-BD79-A0DC2C76C3C7.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/C7/D9/C7D920A0-CB88-48A2-847D-0D3B4530C293.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/3B/86/3B8634EE-0386-4B6C-BB84-44E7EE3543EB.jpg","Standard","Road/Street","True","0"

Pkg. Rotax® 850 E-TEC® Black</h3><strong>RACE-READY RENEGADE</strong><p>With its longer track boosting traction and unstoppable suspension performance from race-sled-spec KYB Pro shocks, the Renegade X-RS sled is a hard-core riders' dream – especially with the REV Gen4 platform and Rotax 850 E-TEC engine combination.</p><ul><li>ROTAX 850 E-TEC ENGINE</li></ul><strong>MORE POWER YOU CAN FEEL</strong><p>The most powerful 2-stroke engine in the industry.* It pumps out 10 more horsepower (165 hp) than its predecessor, but its responsiveness is what really shines. With the new pDrive primary clutch, it’s 30% quicker responding than the 800R E-TEC giving you the instant control you demand.</p><ul><li>PDRIVE CLUTCH</li></ul><strong>QUICK, EFFICIENT, EASY</strong><p>A major factor in the quickness of REV Gen4 sleds is the new pDrive clutch. Fast and friction-free dual rollers transfer torque in place of traditional sliding buttons on this 100% new clutch. The oversize rollers with needle bearings, wide flyweights and shaft-on-shaft design emphasize smooth operation and long life. Ultra-responsive shifting, impressive RPM consistency and 2.8 lb./ 1.3 kg lighter than the TRA VII.</p><ul><li>REV Gen4 PLATFORM</li></ul><strong>NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</strong><p>Created with the Rotax 850 E-TEC engine to be the ultimate handling trail snowmobile. The 4th generation of the REV Gen4 platform is designed around aggressive trail riders with a narrow, compact package giving the rider more freedom to move and influence the sled. More centralized masses (especially side-to-side), light weight and industry-leading suspensions make the vehicle ultra responsive.</p><ul><li>RAS 3 FRONT SUSPENSION</li></ul><strong>PRECISION FRONT END</strong><p>Similar geometry and design to the stable and precise RAS 2, optimized for the REV Gen4 platform with 1 in./25mm added suspension stroke and .7 lbs (3,2 kg) reduced weight vs. RAS 2. Even more precise with rack steering system that eliminates all bump steer.</p><ul><li>ERGO-STEP SIDE PANELS</li></ul><strong>RIDE HOW  YOU WANT</strong><p>Design enables you to slide naturally to three different cornering styles, including a new, extreme-forward position.</p><ul><li>OPEN TOE-HOLD</li></ul><strong>LET IT HANG OUT</strong><p>Enables rider to naturally pivot their outside foot outward in aggressive cornering. (Alternative toe holds available as accessories).</p><ul><li>RMOTION REAR SUSPENSION</li></ul><strong>CAPABILITY, CONTROL AND COMFORT</strong><p>Provides more capability, more comfort and more adjustability. Separate spring and shock dynamics combine with the most rising-rate/progressive motion ratio in the industry to give the rMotion suspension a supple ride in small bumps with added capability in large ones. And there’s no need to be a suspension guru to enjoy the ride – with its broad sweet spot, you can set it up once and it will perform impressively in nearly every condition.</p><ul><li>X-RS FEATURES</li></ul><strong>RACE READY</strong><p>Designed for the toughest terrain racing, the X-RS package includes special features. The steering post is more forward for the most aggressive cornering and stand-up riding position. And running boards are reinforced for tough landings.</p><ul><li>KYB PRO SHOCKS</li></ul><strong>PRO-LEVEL SHOCKS</strong><p>These shocks are standard on the MXZx 600RS race sled - so you know they're extremely capable and durable for control in the toughest conditions. Remote reservoir design for performance and they are a rebuildable/revalvable. Easy Adjust compression damping knob does not require tools; rebound adjustments are standard as well.</p><ul><li>RS RUNNING BOARDS</li></ul><strong>ROOM TO ROAM</strong><p>Designed for aggressive stand-up riding, they are flatter for most of their length, wider and strong.

Rotax&#174; 850 E-TEC&#174; Black</h3><strong>RACE-READY RENEGADE</strong><p>With its longer track boosting traction and unstoppable suspension performance from race-sled-spec KYB Pro shocks, the Renegade X-RS sled is a hard-core riders' dream – especially with the REV Gen4 platform and Rotax 850 E-TEC engine combination.</p><ul><li>ROTAX 850 E-TEC ENGINE</li></ul><strong>MORE POWER YOU CAN FEEL</strong><p>The most powerful 2-stroke engine in the industry.* It pumps out 10 more horsepower (165 hp) than its predecessor, but its responsiveness is what really shines. With the new pDrive primary clutch, it&#8217;s 30% quicker responding than the 800R E-TEC giving you the instant control you demand.</p><ul><li>PDRIVE CLUTCH</li></ul><strong>QUICK, EFFICIENT, EASY</strong><p>A major factor in the quickness of REV Gen4 sleds is the new pDrive clutch. Fast and friction-free dual rollers transfer torque in place of traditional sliding buttons on this 100% new clutch. The oversize rollers with needle bearings, wide flyweights and shaft-on-shaft design emphasize smooth operation and long life. Ultra-responsive shifting, impressive RPM consistency and 2.8 lb./ 1.3 kg lighter than the TRA VII.</p><ul><li>REV Gen4 PLATFORM</li></ul><strong>NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</strong><p>Created with the Rotax 850 E-TEC engine to be the ultimate handling trail snowmobile. The 4th generation of the REV Gen4 platform is designed around aggressive trail riders with a narrow, compact package giving the rider more freedom to move and influence the sled. More centralized masses (especially side-to-side), light weight and industry-leading suspensions make the vehicle ultra responsive.</p><ul><li>RAS 3 FRONT SUSPENSION</li></ul><strong>PRECISION FRONT END</strong><p>Similar geometry and design to the stable and precise RAS 2, optimized for the REV Gen4 platform with 1 in./25mm added suspension stroke and .7 lbs (3,2 kg) reduced weight vs. RAS 2. Even more precise with rack steering system that eliminates all bump steer.</p><ul><li>ERGO-STEP SIDE PANELS</li></ul><strong>RIDE HOW YOU WANT</strong><p>Design enables you to slide naturally to three different cornering styles, including a new, extreme-forward position.</p><ul><li>OPEN TOE-HOLD</li></ul><strong>LET IT HANG OUT</strong><p>Enables rider to naturally pivot their outside foot outward in aggressive cornering. (Alternative toe holds available as accessories).</p><ul><li>RMOTION REAR SUSPENSION</li></ul><strong>CAPABILITY, CONTROL AND COMFORT</strong><p>Provides more capability, more comfort and more adjustability. Separate spring and shock dynamics combine with the most rising-rate/progressive motion ratio in the industry to give the rMotion suspension a supple ride in small bumps with added capability in large ones. And there&#8217;s no need to be a suspension guru to enjoy the ride – with its broad sweet spot, you can set it up once and it will perform impressively in nearly every condition.</p><ul><li>X-RS FEATURES</li></ul><strong>RACE READY</strong><p>Designed for the toughest terrain racing, the X-RS package includes special features. The steering post is more forward for the most aggressive cornering and stand-up riding position. And running boards are reinforced for tough landings.</p><ul><li>KYB PRO SHOCKS</li></ul><strong>PRO-LEVEL SHOCKS</strong><p>These shocks are standard on the MXZx 600RS race sled - so you know they're extremely capable and durable for control in the toughest conditions. Remote reservoir design for performance and they are a rebuildable/revalvable. Easy Adjust compression damping knob does not require tools; rebound adjustments are standard as well.</p><ul><li>RS RUNNING BOARDS</li></ul><strong>ROOM TO ROAM</strong><p>Designed for aggressive stand-up riding, they are flatter for most of their length, wider and strong. Thicker aluminum sheet (3 mm vs. 1.8 mm), plus front and rear reinforcements to withstand tough landings.</p><br>","BLACK ","BLACK ","","","","","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/06/A1/06A1F88C-18E2-49B6-8581-B7E35B0F6D19.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/5E/09/5E09D8AD-DC97-42A4-9997-12A177A9D9BC.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/35/33/3533F891-8358-4E60-ADA1-CBB7B41D62F2.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/02/73/0273BA49-554E-4712-965B-C93747D8A593.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/77/E8/77E8872A-DE69-480F-BA48-782E9455646C.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A5/A2/A5A2A2CD-FFE6-4705-828D-E52C514B4730.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/B2/B7/B2B7F442-27DE-4AD1-BDB2-163E77268B8A.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A7/40/A740816F-426B-411A-826B-673EBA9A746D.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/5C/E9/5CE94EF3-55F4-4769-88EC-BDBFC431DBA7.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/AE/1C/AE1CE2CD-A74A-4B3F-9D7E-5A3F04D66054.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/64/54/645405C0-6A5B-4A50-AD8E-14818E94AA9E.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/E5/E0/E5E0B586-9ADD-487F-B1C2-9E172C250822.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/DB/B9/DBB9E250-3530-4A11-B218-753BB7DAD725.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/01/88/018863F9-78AE-44DB-AE4C-FBADE627946E.jpg","Crossover","","True","0"

Even though the Chief Vintage borrows a few iconic styling cues from history, every ride is brand new.</p>","BLACK","BLACK","","","","","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/E0/8D/E08D6266-DD90-4F34-8D5A-9FA28901A234.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/B8/3D/B83D0512-7B11-423D-B022-6351394C1888.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/44/98/44982E5D-F048-4B2E-AD4F-8444D9CDE144.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/86/30/86308B22-9606-41C6-A78D-4DE2558C092B.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/AE/14/AE14E70F-6FC3-4D34-BC60-3FDC251EF35C.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/2A/9E/2A9E8E77-490E-4A8F-8DBD-4EEB7A1415CF.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/19/C9/19C9A5A5-588D-4AD8-85EA-F595B31D3699.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/F8/18/F818F4A6-295C-41A2-9024-9F256010E484.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/24/8F/248F7EB8-D2DC-49DD-A4EE-C0B9E9B4682B.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/49/CA/49CAE381-44C1-4CDC-A8AC-2267CEFA74E9.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/F6/81/F681EE66-6E6E-44A2-8D78-F269C9E41E46.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/64/92/64925BAF-57C0-47F9-B207-8F3185DC6BD7.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/6B/90/6B90B9B0-3B85-4E7B-8DAF-91112A2DB6E4.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/78/23/7823C25A-42CC-4082-A114-F55F75199FB2.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/63/B2/63B29ADE-9BC2-4D9B-88FB-DC3959105B2C.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/80/10/80109CC6-1DE8-43BB-95FB-C338BA78F491.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/5B/BA/5BBA1D1E-81CC-44AA-A2D6-DA89DA3B77C6.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/5F/CA/5FCAF2AF-A53C-4EB1-8AE5-993904A325BB.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/CE/80/CE808B61-E1CB-4CCD-8185-767E4D7408E6.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/9A/B5/9AB50AA9-9803-454B-9EAA-17A289CE419F.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A3/95/A395B98A-974C-4AA9-9CF0-D0CA71890074.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/BA/9D/BA9DEB0B-7A0C-4D9B-8602-780B3983612F.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/22/F7/22F72EA3-1613-4926-AE00-624F0D768B1E.jpg","Cruiser","Road/Street","True","0"

The ""Performance package"" boosts the Testastretta 11° DS engine to 145 CV and makes the power easy to handle thanks to race-derived Brembo brakes and the fundamental Öhlins suspension. The carbon front mudguard and the machined rims with their light, aggressive design are the signature of every ""S"" version. Let yourself be guided by your Monster instinct.</p><strong>Features May Include:</strong><p></p><strong>Testastretta 11° DS</strong><p>The new Monster 1200 family is powered by the second generation of Testastretta 11° DS engine, smoother and with dual spark plugs and a secondary air system. Dual Spark (DS) ignition uses two plugs per cylinder to ensure complete combustion in a very short time. A secondary air system similar to that of the 1199 Panigale has been introduced to optimise operation and reduce cyclic combustion variability without affecting emissions. A controlled flow of fresh air is supplied to the exhaust duct to enable complete oxidisation of hot unburnt gases, to effectively reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels.</p><strong>Tailored ergonomics</strong><p>The new Monster 1200 range features a totally redefined size, and ergonomics designed to offer ""one-bike-in-the-garage"" versatility. The new Monster size ensures ample accomodations even for a rider 185 cm tall and a passenger 175 cm tall, also allowing baggage to be loaded without compromises. The seat position is very comfortable, allowing long distance riding if desired; the riding position is upright thanks to a high handlebar fixed close to the rider; and a passenger seat with easily removed cover, low passenger footpegs, and integrated passenger handles welcome anyone the rider wishes to bring along.</p><strong>Performance package</strong><p>The Monster 1200 S comes standard with a ""performance package"" that offers more power (+ 10 Hp) and torque (+ 1 Kgm), front and rear Ohlins suspension components, and a Superbike-spec Brembo brake system. The front mudguard in carbon fibre and the Y-pattern 3-spoke machined wheels complete the ""S"" equipment. In EU markets, the Monster 1200 S also features LED turn lights.</p><strong>Personalise your style</strong><p>Take the Monster one step beyond its iconic design with three different kits to personalise your motorcycle.

The on-road part is usually pretty easy, but the off-road part separates the best bikes from the rest. And that’s exactly where Honda’s extraordinary CRF450RL shines the brightest. It’s such a good off-road bike that this year we’ve even changed its name, showing how closely it’s derived from our CRF450R and CRF450X models. For 2021 we’ve also added factory handguards, new graphics, and updated ECU and fuel-injection settings. The best parts are still its powerful 449cc Unicam engine, twin-spar aluminum chassis, wide-ratio six-speed transmission, long-travel suspension, and effortless electric starting. And then there are the specs nobody can match: Honda quality and reliability.</p><p><strong>Features may include:</strong></p><strong>VERSATILITY</strong><ul><li>FULLY STREET LEGAL &amp; OFF-ROAD CAPABLE</li></ul><p> The CRF450RL is equipped with a catalytic converter and is fully street legal in all 50 states—and off-road capable just about anywhere on the planet.

Some say riding lets us be heroes of our own adventures. From the moment we fire up our engines and take to the trails, we become the thrill-seekers we were born to be. With great power and great cornering ability comes great responsibility. You see, when we’re not hammering the throttle on the racetrack, we’re hammering it in the workshop. Figuring out ways to improve on 50 years of refinement - one breakthrough at a time. That’s how we move the speedometer forward. Always have.</p><p><strong>Features may include:</strong></p><strong>Slide-Action Rear Suspension</strong><p>Slide-Action maintains a free-acting front arm while coupling under torque over bumps, and during aggressive cornering and acceleration. As the rear transfer blocks are engaged, the front arm follows the bumps, keeping your skis firmly planted as your 129-in. track propels you down the trail.</p><strong>Arctic Race Front Suspension</strong><p>Tall, lightweight ski spindles and widely spaced A-arms provide great torsion rigidity and strength. Angling the shock load back toward the rider's mass, results in optimal caster/camber to improve comfort and cornering. FOX FLOAT® 3 shocks and a sway bar provide excellent control and handling.</p><strong>9000 C-TEC4™ Engine</strong><p>This turbo produces an industry-leading 177 HP at any altitude. The response is instant. Power delivery is smooth. Electronic fuel injection means starting your sled will be effortless, even at the highest elevations and coldest temperatures.</p><strong>ProCross Chassis</strong><p>This chassis excels at bringing weight-saving technology to the performance-obsessed rider. The ProCross™ features a tapered two-piece tunnel design. Narrow at the top, wider at the bottom. A forged steering housing ties together many of the load-bearing chassis components.</p><strong>Deluxe Digital/Analog Gauge</strong><p>The deluxe gauge lets you choose between digital and analog speed and tachometer readouts. There's also an odometer, two trip meters, engine hour meter, reverse indicator and warning lights.</p><strong>Electric Start</strong><p>With a simple turn of the key, the new and improved electric start is reliable and effective. Not to mention the easiest way to ignite the fun.</p><strong>Push-Button Reverse</strong><p>The push-button reverse is all about quick, easy activation. Just hit the button and backward you go.</p><strong>Front Sport Bumper</strong><p>These lightweight aluminum bumpers add superior protection and a bold, stylish look. They are scratch resistant and have a powder-coat finish.</p><strong>1.25-in. Ripsaw™ Track</strong><p>Features aggressive angled-lug profiles for outstanding forward and lateral traction on groomed trails. Its “chopped” lug design delivers excellent handling, acceleration and braking on hard-packed surfaces.</p>","","4UF15SNW1FT117570 ","","","","","","","","0","False","False","","","False","0","False","","255","TURBO MOTOR 4 STROKE,  TALL SHIELD,  REAR BAG,  ICE RIPPER TRACK,","TURBO MOTOR 4 STROKE,  TALL SHIELD,  REAR BAG,  ICE RIPPER TRACK,","","Snowmobile","","","14499","http://www.roadtrackandtrail.com/--xInventoryDetail?id=12989532","9","TURBO MOTOR 4 STROKE, TALL SHIELD, REAR BAG, ICE RIPPER TRACK,<br /> <br /> <h3>2015 Arctic Cat&#174; ZR 9000 Sno Pro&#174;</h3><p>Why do Arctic riders RIDE MORE&#8482;?

Be legendary.</p>","BLUE/CREAM","BLUE/CREAM","","","","","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/33/12/3312A2DF-857F-4F5E-9B59-C0391E1D3026.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/D4/F5/D4F5B564-BFCE-4DE6-9A7F-0EFA6E57EB9F.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/21/CC/21CCB388-D90B-456B-8B2D-FB3E0E5AB913.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/D0/31/D0318599-C31F-47EF-A1E3-95B57ECDFA5F.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/79/01/79014BB9-CCF0-4189-A426-D01345A31C92.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/93/9B/939B778B-242E-4257-84C1-2FEF6B0045F4.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/18/97/1897E6D9-E286-401A-B4BF-34F67A5252FE.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/85/5E/855EDE20-E299-41EB-8EFE-6E13697DD677.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A1/52/A152AF00-2F7B-4B76-B3FC-30B8F9FBF8F1.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/02/E0/02E0B7E9-685D-4744-9F46-D40AD02AE575.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/58/AB/58ABAA93-47D9-4F0D-8102-961819B38405.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/9C/37/9C379628-5D03-428A-9F0E-1577F194F02A.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/BE/2B/BE2B0499-B444-4E0B-890A-6E208C96DF20.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/A0/A7/A0A77E95-F8A3-46A5-9743-427B847E7843.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/48/9C/489C390C-8095-429C-A493-B824A05F7475.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/77/BB/77BBDAE5-06E3-4456-9C5B-35942594A243.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/E4/4F/E44F7093-778A-4B19-BE5E-FB5EDF41CFAC.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/F2/4D/F24D2467-D865-4C02-B0CE-3C845137E0CB.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/C0/20/C020A9C5-AB1B-49DD-B27F-BAAA60FC781E.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/09/DE/09DE3FDF-035A-499D-893E-DDC492544627.jpg,https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/1024x1024/imglib/Assets/Inventory/65/6C/656C57A0-765D-494D-B0C1-41F28A24A946.jpg","Cruiser","Road/Street","True","0"

And To Have Fun Doing It.</strong><p>We think motorcycles should be about getting out and enjoying the world around you. The sun, the smells, the wind, the weather. More reality and less virtual. And you know what’s even better? If you could find one bike that could do it all. Let you go exploring in the dirt. Zip along mountain roads. Commute to work every day.

Well, guess what—the CRF®250L and new CRF®250L Rally are going to be the perfect bikes for all those things.</p><p>First, the CRF®250L: We’ve given it some great new updates for 2017. Some highlights: A larger throttle body improves the feel of the bike’s low- and mid-range power, as does the new muffler design, revised airbox, and larger diameter exhaust header. And check out its new graphic treatment, matched up to our CRF®450R MX bike. The all-new CRF®250L Rally gets the same updated engine as the standard 250L, but it also gets a larger fuel tank, totally new Dakar-style bodywork, handguards, a windscreen, skid plate and even more suspension travel. And both give you a great upright seating position that’s comfortable for longer rides, ideal for both urban traffic or out on the trail. They’re even available with optional ABS.</p><strong>Features may include:</strong><ul><li>Packs a punch.</li></ul><p>At the heart of our CRF®250L and CRF®250L Rally lies a fuel-injected single-cylinder engine, complete with an electric starter, counterbalance, and double-overhead cams.
